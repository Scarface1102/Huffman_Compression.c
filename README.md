Huffman Coding Compression Algorithm

**About**

* Huffman Coding is a lossless data compression algorithm that efficiently encodes data using variable-length prefix codes. It reduces the average bit-length of characters based on their frequency in the input, making it an effective method for compressing text and binary data.

**Features**

* Lossless compression with optimal encoding: Ensures that no data is lost during the compression and decompression process while minimizing storage requirements.

* Uses binary tree based approach to construct an optimal Huffman Tree, assigning shorter codes to more frequently occurring characters.

* The algorithm efficiently encodes and decodes data by using a structured binary tree, ensuring fast lookup and reconstruction.

* Widely used in compression formats like file compression, text encoding etc.
